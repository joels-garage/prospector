# URL regular expressions and corresponding filenames.
# format:
# filename = regex
# e.g.:
# xsltexample.xsl = regex.*example
# note leading slash, for Class.getResource()
# maybe we'll make little directories in there, so these are paths.

/gov.usda.plants.characteristics.xsl = http://plants.usda.gov/java/charProfile.*

# the overview seems to have nothing that the detail doesn't, so i'll remove it for now
/gov.usda.plants.overview.xsl        = http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile.*

# whoops, to make the test work, I need to put another row here but i dont' want it to match
#/gov.usda.plants.overview.xsl        = http://www.joelsgarage.com/java/profile.*
